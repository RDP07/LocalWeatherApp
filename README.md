# LocalWeatherApp

This is a web app I have built for users local weather. The application pulls geolocation data from an API and based off the users IP then passes that data through a current weather API, to return the local weather for the user. The backgrounds are also dynamic and will change depending on the current weather conditions. There is a button to convert the deg farenheit to deg celcius if the user wishes as well. It is all written with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, JQuery, and AJAX.
